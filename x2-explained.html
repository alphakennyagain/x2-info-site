    <div class="version">
      <h2>X2 2025 REBORN Version</h2>
      <p>
        The X2 2025 REBORN is the latest version offering full functionality for both <strong>debit and credit dumps</strong>. 
        While not officially developed by the original creator/renowned developer of X2 Softwares, it has been widely used and praised for its efficiency and reliability. 
        With a proven <strong>99% success rate</strong>, it stands out as one of the best unofficial releases currently available.

    <div class="version">
      <h2>X2 2025 EMBOSSED Version</h2>
      <p>
        Created by a seasoned expert with over four years of experience in credit processing, the X2 2025 EMBOSSED version has undergone extensive testing. 
        It operates <strong>flawlessly without errors</strong>, although it may run slightly slower compared to other variants. 
        Currently, it supports <strong>credit only</strong>, but the developer has confirmed that debit functionality will be added in future updates. 
        It is currently still in its <em>beta phase</em>. It isalso constantly updated but because of its inability to cl0ne debit dumps it is seen as lesser in value.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="version">
      <h2>X2 2024 Version</h2>
      <p>
        The X2 2024 version was developed by the original creator known as <strong>"MR EMV"</strong>, who built all versions from 2022 through 2024. 
        This version remains the last functioning release under his development legacy. 
        While it still works, it <strong>lacks compatibility with 2025 data files</strong> and may not support the latest systems or formats. Thus, is sold cheaper.
